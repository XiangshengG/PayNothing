# PayNothing
A mobile app development project for local bartering.
Users can post their items that are available to trade locally in the form of short videos, such that they can show their items in actions and introduce them without typing description or taking pictures. 
For each video post of items, other users can be in the role of moderator and add comments and their opinions. Also, allow users to have conversations related to items, and inform users to complete their local transaction in public places for their safety.
